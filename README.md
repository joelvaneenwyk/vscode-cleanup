# Remove old versions / duplicate extensions for VS Code

## Why the script

The essence of the problem is that when you update extensions in VS Code, old versions are not deleted, but remain and occupy free space. If you have a large number of extensions, it is quite problematic to delete them manually.

## What the script does

This Python script helps you identify and manage duplicate extensions within your VS Code extensions directory. It can:

* Find duplicate extensions based on their names and semantic versions.
* Display a report of duplicate extensions, excluding the latest versions.
* Optionally remove old duplicates, moving them to a separate folder.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sv222/RemoveVSCodeOldVersions && cd RemoveVSCodeOldVersions
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.vscode\extensions"  # Replace with your actual path to your VS Code extensions directory.
    ```

4. **Follow the prompts to view the report and choose whether to remove duplicates.**
5. **Your old extensions will be moved to the "old_versions" folder in the same directory as the script.**

## Key Features

* **Semantic version parsing:** Uses the `semver` library to accurately parse version strings.
* **Clear reporting:** Provides a user-friendly report of duplicate extensions and their versions.
* **Customizable target directory:** You can easily provide the path to your extensions directory via the `extensions_path` argument.
